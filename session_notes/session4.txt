You make a slightly unrealistic modeling assumption
and in some sense you get a mathematically degenerate model!


H(q) = 1/(2C) * q^2
dH/dq = q/C (voltage)
two cap. in parallel (without taking the wire's resistance into account)
q1 = (C1 / C2) q2 (constraint must be satisfied in particular by inital condition)
=> final equations contain an algebraic contstraint that volateges must equal
so, they are not a system of ODEs but DAEs (which are in general much harder solve)
The current which balances the charge between the two capacitors
such that they have the same voltage is a Lagrange multiplier.

In fluid mechanics, if you have incompressibility contstriant
gives you a constraint which cannot be elimintated with just simplification of the euations
The pressure which balances the mass density (between adjacent mesh volumes)
such that the density remains constant is a Lagrange multiplier.
