# Introduction

This is the repository of the master thesis "On the identification of port-Hamiltonian models via machine-learning".

# Get Started

All scripts are sorted and grouped according to the chapters and sections numbering in the thesis. A part of the code is also included in the thesis, but the code in this repository contains more details.

It is recommended to start with [7.3_Experiment_idho](https://git.ltd.uni-erlangen.de/JiandongZhao/master-thesis/-/blob/main/src/examples_in_thesis/Chapter%207%20Compositional%20Modelling/7.3_Experiment_idho.jl). In this script, we illustrate the training and evaluation step by step.

Under the folder [Chapter 7 Compositional Modelling](https://git.ltd.uni-erlangen.de/JiandongZhao/master-thesis/-/tree/main/src/examples_in_thesis/Chapter%207%20Compositional%20Modelling), there are four folders:

- figures: stores the result plots.
- helpers: provides some useful helper functions for reuse.
- models: stores the trained neural network models.
- parameters: stores the parameters of the neural networks.
