The port-Hamiltonian systems theory provides a port-based modelling approach, with which complex multiphysical systems can be expressed by interconnection of basic components.  The Exergetic Port-Hamiltonian Systems modeling framework combines the classical port-Hamiltonian systems theory with the GENERIC framework, such that exergetic port-Hamiltonian systems are endowed with structural properties, which imply the first and second law of thermodynamics. In the Exergetic Port-Hamiltonian Systems modeling framework, a system consists of subsystems and the environment, where some subsystems may be unknown. In this thesis, we introduce Structured Neural ODEs and use them to construct an IVP. By solving this IVP with numerical method, we obtain the predicted state trajectories. We train neural network models for the subsystems of interest so that these models can be substituted for the subsystems and reused for other systems.
